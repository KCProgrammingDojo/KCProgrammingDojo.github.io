	</div><br><br>
	<div id = about2>
		Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. In this class, we cover basic Java topics such as variables, conditionals, loops, strings, arrays, etc.
		<br><br>
		The best way to learn to code is with lots of practice. Practice can help make the coding process quicker and easier. Practice using the link below. It has content review and multiple choice quizzes to practice Java skills.

		HTML & CSS
	</div><br><br>
	<div id = about2>
		HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications.
		<br><br>
		We will cover many of the HTML and CSS concepts that will help you build your own stunning websites, but other websites are always a good point of reference. W3 Schools is a great website that has many tutorials for features that we may not cover in class.

		Python
	</div><br><br>
	<div id = about2>
		Created by mathematician Guido van Rossum, Python is a relatively easy to learn programming language. Its use is nearly ubiquitous, with applications ranging from websites to artificial intelligence.
		<br><br>
		During classes, we will cover everything from basic scripting to machine learning in python. Get a head-first start by clicking here.
